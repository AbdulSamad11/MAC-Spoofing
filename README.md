# MAC-Spoofing
MAC spoofing using Python 3
Change the MAC address while the program is running and then automatically revert to the original MAC address if the program stops running.
Make sure to replace "your_wifi_interface" with the name of your Wi-Fi adapter (e.g., "wlan0"). Replace "00:11:22:33:44:55" with the MAC address you want to use temporarily. This script will change the MAC address while the program is running and revert it to the original MAC address when the program exits.
